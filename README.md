modsolve: An interactive solver of associative learning models
==============================================================

This is an experimental version of a work-in-progress software for the
analysis of associative learning models. Implemented right now are a
generic kernel machine model and specialization for the 'replaced
elements' model (see Wagner 2008) and Pearce's configural models (see
Pearce 1987, 1994).

The interface, and almost everything, is subject to change.

Installation
------------


There are no installation scripts right now. You can clone the github
repository and load the modsolve module into a running python
instance. See examples.py for some examples.

You need to install Sympy and, optionally, matplotlib for
graphics. See http://www.sympy.org for instructions.
