Features planned for almonds
============================

Models
------

- Sympy can do differential equations. So we can program a full
  solution of the Rescorla-Wagner model and kernel machine models
  including learning curves.

- Explore various representation scheme that generalize the replaced
  elements model.

- Program solution of comparator theory.


Plotting
--------

- Detach plotting window so that one can continue working without
  closing it.

- Add plots to open window


User interface
--------------

- Separate design from models, making a design class that is available
  to non-kernel-machine models
